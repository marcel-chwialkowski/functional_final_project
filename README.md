# Functional programming final projecct

*Authors: Marcel Chwiałkowski, Aditi Sadwelkar*

We wrote a turn-based game. As a player, you spawn in a binary tree and you are tasked with eliminating all your enemies while eliminating as few of your allies as possible. There are 2 ways of eliminating players:

* kill - this action kills a single enemy in your node
* cut off - this action cuts off the branches of the tree below you, killing everyone there (possibly some allies!)

The game ends when you die or the all enemies die.

## Files

### Cmd.hs

Contains the commands available in the game. Just an extended version of *Binary Tree World* Cmd.hs file.

### GameLoop.hs

Main file. Contains the game loop and functions to start and end the game.

* As the game contains a lot of state variables that are modified at every turn, we decided to use StateT to handle everything:

```haskell
data GameState = GameState
  {binzip :: BinZip Int,
   enZips :: [BinZip Int],
   frZips :: [BinZip Int],
   enRem :: Int,
   frRem :: Int,
   turn :: Int,
   hp :: Int,
   vision :: Int,
   freeze :: Bool}

type Game = StateT GameState IO
```

* go - function representing the game loop.
* gameSetup - creates a random tree for the game to take place on and places allies and enemies on the tree.
* endGame - gives the player his score and asks him to play again - then restarts the game loop or quits according to the answer.

### treestuff.hs

Contains most of the 'backend'. Some important functions:

* randomTree - creates a random binary tree with empty labels of specified maximal depth
* intractPreOrd - fills in the labels of a given tree
* randomLabels - generates a list with randomized labels for the tree (the result of this function is later given to intractPreOrd)
* moveLeftUpdate, moveRightUpdate, moveDownUpdate - movement for non-playable characters. The signifcant difference between the player movement and those functions is that they modify labels of the tree.
* adjustLabeling - given a binary tree and a zipper on a tree with the same structure, it adjusts the labels within the zipper so that they agree with the labels on the tree
* adjustLabelingRobust - similar, but without the "same structure" guarantee - i.e., the tree given is a subset of the tree on which the zipper is defined. Therefore, if the zipper doesn't exist on the argument tree Nothing is returned.
* createFriendZippers, createEnemyZippers - given tree with labels, extract list of zippers representing friends/enemies' positions.
* killZipper - given a zipper and a list of zippers, removes a zipper from the list based on equality test with the other argument.
* moveInd, moveGroup - moves around a list of zipper on the trees, updating all other zippers at the same time. Used for moving friends and enemies.

### Parser.hs

Just a slightly extended version of the parser for *Binary Tree World.*
